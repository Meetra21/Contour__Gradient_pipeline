# Contour & Gradient Feature Pipelines for Handwritten Character Recognition

This repository provides **baseline pipelines** for handwritten digit and letter recognition using **contour-based boundary features** and **central-difference image gradients**.  
Instead of convolutional networks, we train **MLP classifiers** directly on engineered gradient features.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Boundary extraction** using Canny edges (or morphological gradient as fallback).
- **Central-difference gradients** (gx, gy) with optional **gradient magnitude**.
- **Masked gradient features** â†’ model focuses on strokes and contours.
- **Global feature standardization** for stable MLP training.
- **Multi-layer Perceptron classifier** with BatchNorm, Dropout, and LeakyReLU.
- **Callbacks** for early stopping and learning-rate scheduling.

## ðŸ“Š Results (baseline)

- **MNIST Digits**:  
  > Accuracy ~98â€“99% with 3-channel gradient features.  
- **EMNIST Letters**:  
  > Accuracy ~88â€“92% (letters are more challenging).

(Exact results may vary depending on training parameters and hardware.)
